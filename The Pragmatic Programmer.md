## Preface

What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?

- Characteristics of a Pragmatic programmer:
  - Early adopter/fast adapter: You have a knack for tech and techniques, and love experimenting.
  - Inquisitive: You tend to ask questions and collect small, useful facts.
  - Critical thinker: You rarely accept things at face value without first gathering the facts.
  - Realistic: You aim to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face.
  - Jack of all trades: You strive to be familiar with a wide range of technologies and
    environments.

  ``` md
  Tip 1: Care About Your Craft
  ```

  - There is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.

  ``` md
  Tip 2: Think! About Your Work
  ```

  - Constantly critique your work in real-time. The old IBM corporate motto, THINK!, is the
Pragmatic Programmer's mantra.

Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams

- Within the overall structure of a project, there is always room for individuality and
  craftsmanship.

It's a Continuous Process

- Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire.

## Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

### 1. It's Your Life

- It is your life; you own it, you run it, you create it.

``` md
Tip 3: You Have Agency
```

- As Martin Fowler says, "You can change your organization or change your organization".
- The software industry offers remarkable opportunities. Be proactive and seize them.

### 2. The Cat Ate My Source Code

- Pragmatic Programmers take charge of their careers, and aren't afraid to admit ignorance or error.
- Research shows that trust within a team is essential for fostering creativity and collaboration.
- When you accept the responsibility for an outcome, be prepared to be held accountable for it.

``` md
Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
```

- Instead of offering excuses, provide actionable solutions. Instead of saying, "It can't be done,"
  explain what can be done to salvage the situation.

### 3. Software Entropy

- "Entropy" is a term from physics that refers to the amount of "disorder" in a system. In software,
  we call increasing disorder "software rot".
- Psychologists have studied how hopelessness can be contagious. Think of it like a flu virus
  spreading in close quarters. Ignoring clearly broken situations reinforces negative beliefs:
  nothing can be fixed, no one cares, and all is doomed; These thoughts can be spread among team
  members, creating a vicious cycle.

``` md
Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows
```

- Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix them
 as soon as they're discovered. If you can't fix them properly due to time constraints, board
 them up as a temporary measure.
- Avoid causing collateral damage, even in a crisis.

### 4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- Sometimes, the vision for the entire system is clear—you know it's right. Yet, asking for
  permission to tackle everything at once often leads to delays, blank stares, committee meetings,
  and budget hurdles.
- Instead, bring out the "stones." Focus on a reasonable, achievable request. Execute it well, then
  showcase the results. Once people see it, suggest, “Of course, it would be even better if we
  added…”
- Success attracts support. Provide a glimpse of what's possible, and others will rally behind you.

``` md
Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change
```

- Most software disasters begin too small to notice. Project overruns creep in day by day, as
  features drift from specifications and patches pile onto code until nothing original remains. This
  gradual accumulation of small issues can break morale and teams.

``` md
Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture
```

- It's said that a frog dropped into boiling water will leap out immediately. However, placed in
  cold water that's gradually heated, the frog fails to notice the change and remains until it's too
  late. Unlike the Broken Window Theory, where neglect leads to widespread apathy, the frog's
  failure stems from gradual, unperceived change.

### 5. Good-Enough Software

- Writing "good enough" software ensures it meets user needs, satisfies maintainers, and boosts
  productivity. Shorter development cycles often result in happier users and improved program
  quality.
- Ignoring user needs for new features or over-polishing is unprofessional, as is cutting corners or
  setting unrealistic deadlines.

``` md
Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue
```

- Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow.
- Know when to stop: Avoid ruining a good program through overembellishment and overrefinement.

### 6. Your Knowledge Portfolio

- "An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest." - Benjamin Franklin
- Managing a knowledge portfolio mirrors financial portfolio management:
  - Invest in knowledge consistently: small, regular efforts build the habit and yield lasting
    results.
  - Diversify your knowledge to adapt to change: master current tech, explore new ones, and build
    soft skills.
  - Balance risks in tech: explore both high-reward and stable options; avoid relying on one field.
  - Learn emerging tech early: it's risky but can lead to great rewards as it gains popularity.
  - Review and rebalance: Regularly reassess your skills to stay current with evolving tech and open
    new opportunities.

``` md
Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
```

- Embrace learning opportunities by researching unanswered questions, building your network, and
  using spare time for reading.
- Think critically about sources, ensuring your knowledge is accurate and not influenced by hype.

``` md
Tip 10: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
```

- Critical thinking is a discipline worth studying. Begin by asking deeper questions to uncover root
  causes.
  - The "Five Whys" technique helps dig deeper into an issue by repeatedly asking "why" to
    understand it fully.
  - Ask who benefits from a situation. Analyzing who stands to gain can reveal hidden agendas or
    alignments.
  - Consider the context. Solutions are often not universal, and what works for one may not work for
    another.
  - Assess when and where an idea or solution works. Don't stop with first-order thinking (what will
    happen next), but use second-order thinking: what will happen after that?
  - Investigate underlying problems and models. Understanding the structure behind an issue can
    provide better solutions.

### 7. Communicate!

- It's not just what you've got, but also how you package it. A good idea is an orphan without
  effective communication.
- Treat English (or whatever your native tongue may be) as just another programming language.

``` md
Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language
```

- Effective communication requires understanding your audience; merely talking, without engaging
  them, is ineffective and irritating.
- Plan, outline, and refine to ensure your message suits the audience; apply this to documents,
  meetings, and client talks.
- Understand audience priorities; time your message for relevance and ask, "Is this a good time to
  discuss...?"
- Adapt your style to the audience's needs; offer feedback when necessary, as it's a vital part of
  communication.
- Present ideas professionally; use modern tools, styles, and layout features for polished,
  error-free documents.
- Engage your audience early; seek feedback to build rapport and create better documents through
  collaboration.
- Listen actively; foster dialogue by asking questions and encouraging input to enhance
  understanding and engagement.
- Always respond promptly to messages, even briefly, to keep others informed and maintain trust.

``` md
Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
```

- Treat documentation as integral to development; keep it efficient, non-redundant, and closely tied
  to the code.

``` md
Tip 13: Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt In On
```

- Comment code to explain purpose, goals, and trade-offs; avoid redundant comments that duplicate
  what the code already shows.
